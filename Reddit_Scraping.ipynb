(TYT.L,TM) said Wednesday that it is committed to making battery electric vehicles or BEVs. It expects to sell about 8 million electrified vehicles globally by 2030, of which 2 million will be battery electric vehicles and fuel cell electric vehicles.*\\n\\n*The company expects battery electric vehicles and fuel cell electric vehicles will make up 15% of U.S. sales by 2030, and along with the company's hybrids and plug-in hybrids, 70% of the Toyota and Lexus combined sales mix will be electrified by 2030.*\\n\\n*Earlier in 2021, Lexus unveiled the LF-Z, a conceptual look at the future of BEVs in the luxury segment. That was followed by the debut of the Toyota bZ4X concept, a battery electric SUV that will go into production in 2022.*\\n\\nSource:\\nhttps://www.nasdaq.com/articles/toyota-expects-to-sell-about-8-million-electrified-vehicles-globally-by-2030-2021-05-12\\n\\n---------------------\\n\\nTwo million EVs AND fuel cell vehicles in 2030 is an absolutely shockingly low number. Also, who do they think they will be selling these 6 million hybrid vehicles to? By 2030, EVs will be significantly cheaper than hybrid cars due to the expected battery cost decline of 60-80% this decade. Why would 75% of their customers pay more for a worse product?\\n\\nHow big do you guys think the chance is that Toyota - currently the largest automaker in the world - will become the next Nokia?

Its rear half is covered by an armrest that's rear-hinged for full access, while the front half include a sliding drawer that can but pushed forward under the center screen.\\n\\nYay!\\n\\nIf they can make it compelling at 80k vs a EV Macan, this is going to be amazing.\\n\\nAlso glad it\\u2019ll have CarPlay unlike Rivian and Tesla., How does one define a minivan? Sliding doors? Because otherwise this is a minivan.\\n\\nA luxury minivan with a 0-60 at 3.5 seconds, over 400 miles of range and under $80k sounds awesome to me if those numbers all end up holding true., Not a huge pure EV fan but Lucid vehicles always catch my eye. There\\u2019s only a few cruising around where I live which may be why, but I\\u2019m happy the brand is able to continue expanding into new models., I had a spin in the Air recently, and if the SUV drives anything as well as the normal car does... Because it's by far the best driving EV out there. The electric steering is almost as good as Porsche. The chassis balance is amazing and it's ability to blend stability with comfort is great. And it's built properly and smartly. It felt good to be hustled, and even though the throttle was a bit too sharp, it drove unbelievably well for what it was (enormous 8 billion pound luxury sedan).\\n\\nAnd I think they didn't butcher the styling for the SUV conversion either. There's still a lot of \\\"form follows function\\\", but, it's not too bad. I get the impression that they're producing an \\\"engineering first\\\" product like Mercedes in the 80's did, and Toyota in the 90's did. I hope that's enough for them to survive. It worked for those companies because they're still riding on those coat-tails today.\\n\\nThis being said... it's still an ultra-luxury product. Prices really aren't below $100k so it's unobtanium for the vast majority of people. They have the SUV, and they probably have a few people in the \\\"model 3\\\" affordable car research phase at the moment which is what will allow them to actually survive as a company.\\n\\nAnd final thought - I don't like the new wheel\\\\dash layout. I disagree with TH that the old screen was obscured. The screen was intentionally blank in those areas which were cutoff. I never found myself looking to try and find info. It wasn't broken. And now they've got the squircle, which I'm not a huge fan of.\\n\\n______________\\n\\nxpost from the other thread since this thread looks like it will be \\\"the one\\\", It's giving futuristic minivan, Really well-specced and reasonably attractive family hauler. Will be interesting to see how it prices out vs. the iX, model X and so on once it\\u2019s actually released and we can see real prices and configurations. But seems like it could be a pretty compelling option., I think it looks great, much better than the Air. I think the design language works a lot better, particularly in the rear 3/4 section which I always found awkward on the Air (felt a bit bulbous sort of like OG Panamera almost), Yay another 100k 0-60 in less than 4 seconds 5000lb+ suv. Just what we need!, [deleted], plant soft doll command racial tan society somber dolls crown\\n\\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*\",\n          \"Honestly with all these big manufacturers catching up i have a hard time justifying xpev, nio and Tesla. Because in 5 years when most consumers might be looking to afford a new EV they won't buy a Chinese vehicle when there is a Volkswagen for about the same price, >Toyota plans to be the first company to sell an electric vehicle equipped with a solid-state battery in the early 2020s.\\n\\nThey gonna license this tech? Because it sounds like they're going to have an awesome battery and nothing to put it in for a few years.\\n\\nThat being said Tesla desperately needs the competition so I hope it works out., A prototype next year? I'll believe it when I see it. Scalability and affordability will be important things to look out for., Toyota sound like at best they'll have this to the market by mid-2020 based on these articles.\\n\\nAlso keep in mind, what works great in a lab environment doesn't necessarily work well in the real world. Nissan's first generation Leaf suffered from nearly 40% battery degradation in a single year in real world conditions because of this issue. And Toyota has yet to bring a single battery electric vehicle to market, the best they've done is a Plug-in hybrid with a 39 mile range battery., From an investors stand point, I think all these big manufacturers should spinoff their EVs into new companies. It will help with them with getting more investors imo., Stop using game changer if you want people to take you seriously. You sound like YouTube scam  ads., I like Toyota but I wouldn\\u2019t own their stock, This is definitely going to have huge impact on Toyota and Tesla stocks both! Get a detailed analysis on both of them here: [https://zyne.com/stock/TM](https://zyne.com/stock/TM) & [https://zyne.com/stock/TSLA](https://zyne.com/stock/TSLA)., [removed], This is good for Tesla.\",\n          \"So Tsla is going to be the Shell and Chevron EV Charge station for America?, Tesla owners won\\u2019t be happy, but this is huge. Non Tesla charging stations are universally terrible in my experience., Running a charging network is NOT easy. Just ask any Electrify America network users and they'll tell you a 50/50 chance EA's charging station doesn't work., [deleted], Somehow this was never priced in\\n\\nI feel like investors has very short memory. Guve it few more months, these same reasons will be used to pump the stock further, Tesla is a multi headed monster: auto biz, charging, energy storage, solar (not so much here), Optimus, service.\\n\\nIf the green energy revolution happens like people/governments indicate, Tesla is the all encompassing play\\u00a0, Tesla is giving away their competitive advantage. Their exclusive charging network is the only reason to choose a Tesla over one of the many other options., This was another reason I started buy Tesla a couple years ago, Ive been saying this for years, forget the Tesla cars, the real money is the charging infrastructure. Tesla is already rolling out charging stations that have local battery storage and solar panels on the charging station roofs. So Tesla can purchase power off-peak and charge their local power storage batteries and on sunny days top them up. Then sell the cheap stored off-peak power at the going rate, with solar adding to the margin., Oh boy. Reddit hates Tesla.

(TYT.L,TM) said Wednesday that it is committed to making battery electric vehicles or BEVs. It expects to sell about 8 million electrified vehicles globally by 2030, of which 2 million will be battery electric vehicles and fuel cell electric vehicles.*\\n\\n*The company expects battery electric vehicles and fuel cell electric vehicles will make up 15% of U.S. sales by 2030, and along with the company's hybrids and plug-in hybrids, 70% of the Toyota and Lexus combined sales mix will be electrified by 2030.*\\n\\n*Earlier in 2021, Lexus unveiled the LF-Z, a conceptual look at the future of BEVs in the luxury segment. That was followed by the debut of the Toyota bZ4X concept, a battery electric SUV that will go into production in 2022.*\\n\\nSource:\\nhttps://www.nasdaq.com/articles/toyota-expects-to-sell-about-8-million-electrified-vehicles-globally-by-2030-2021-05-12\\n\\n---------------------\\n\\nTwo million EVs AND fuel cell vehicles in 2030 is an absolutely shockingly low number. Also, who do they think they will be selling these 6 million hybrid vehicles to? By 2030, EVs will be significantly cheaper than hybrid cars due to the expected battery cost decline of 60-80% this decade. Why would 75% of their customers pay more for a worse product?\\n\\nHow big do you guys think the chance is that Toyota - currently the largest automaker in the world - will become the next Nokia?

Its rear half is covered by an armrest that's rear-hinged for full access, while the front half include a sliding drawer that can but pushed forward under the center screen.\\n\\nYay!\\n\\nIf they can make it compelling at 80k vs a EV Macan, this is going to be amazing.\\n\\nAlso glad it\\u2019ll have CarPlay unlike Rivian and Tesla., How does one define a minivan? Sliding doors? Because otherwise this is a minivan.\\n\\nA luxury minivan with a 0-60 at 3.5 seconds, over 400 miles of range and under $80k sounds awesome to me if those numbers all end up holding true., Not a huge pure EV fan but Lucid vehicles always catch my eye. There\\u2019s only a few cruising around where I live which may be why, but I\\u2019m happy the brand is able to continue expanding into new models., I had a spin in the Air recently, and if the SUV drives anything as well as the normal car does... Because it's by far the best driving EV out there. The electric steering is almost as good as Porsche. The chassis balance is amazing and it's ability to blend stability with comfort is great. And it's built properly and smartly. It felt good to be hustled, and even though the throttle was a bit too sharp, it drove unbelievably well for what it was (enormous 8 billion pound luxury sedan).\\n\\nAnd I think they didn't butcher the styling for the SUV conversion either. There's still a lot of \\\"form follows function\\\", but, it's not too bad. I get the impression that they're producing an \\\"engineering first\\\" product like Mercedes in the 80's did, and Toyota in the 90's did. I hope that's enough for them to survive. It worked for those companies because they're still riding on those coat-tails today.\\n\\nThis being said... it's still an ultra-luxury product. Prices really aren't below $100k so it's unobtanium for the vast majority of people. They have the SUV, and they probably have a few people in the \\\"model 3\\\" affordable car research phase at the moment which is what will allow them to actually survive as a company.\\n\\nAnd final thought - I don't like the new wheel\\\\dash layout. I disagree with TH that the old screen was obscured. The screen was intentionally blank in those areas which were cutoff. I never found myself looking to try and find info. It wasn't broken. And now they've got the squircle, which I'm not a huge fan of.\\n\\n______________\\n\\nxpost from the other thread since this thread looks like it will be \\\"the one\\\", It's giving futuristic minivan, Really well-specced and reasonably attractive family hauler. Will be interesting to see how it prices out vs. the iX, model X and so on once it\\u2019s actually released and we can see real prices and configurations. But seems like it could be a pretty compelling option., I think it looks great, much better than the Air. I think the design language works a lot better, particularly in the rear 3/4 section which I always found awkward on the Air (felt a bit bulbous sort of like OG Panamera almost), Yay another 100k 0-60 in less than 4 seconds 5000lb+ suv. Just what we need!, [deleted], plant soft doll command racial tan society somber dolls crown\\n\\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*\",\n          \"Honestly with all these big manufacturers catching up i have a hard time justifying xpev, nio and Tesla. Because in 5 years when most consumers might be looking to afford a new EV they won't buy a Chinese vehicle when there is a Volkswagen for about the same price, >Toyota plans to be the first company to sell an electric vehicle equipped with a solid-state battery in the early 2020s.\\n\\nThey gonna license this tech? Because it sounds like they're going to have an awesome battery and nothing to put it in for a few years.\\n\\nThat being said Tesla desperately needs the competition so I hope it works out., A prototype next year? I'll believe it when I see it. Scalability and affordability will be important things to look out for., Toyota sound like at best they'll have this to the market by mid-2020 based on these articles.\\n\\nAlso keep in mind, what works great in a lab environment doesn't necessarily work well in the real world. Nissan's first generation Leaf suffered from nearly 40% battery degradation in a single year in real world conditions because of this issue. And Toyota has yet to bring a single battery electric vehicle to market, the best they've done is a Plug-in hybrid with a 39 mile range battery., From an investors stand point, I think all these big manufacturers should spinoff their EVs into new companies. It will help with them with getting more investors imo., Stop using game changer if you want people to take you seriously. You sound like YouTube scam  ads., I like Toyota but I wouldn\\u2019t own their stock, This is definitely going to have huge impact on Toyota and Tesla stocks both! Get a detailed analysis on both of them here: [https://zyne.com/stock/TM](https://zyne.com/stock/TM) & [https://zyne.com/stock/TSLA](https://zyne.com/stock/TSLA)., [removed], This is good for Tesla.\",\n          \"So Tsla is going to be the Shell and Chevron EV Charge station for America?, Tesla owners won\\u2019t be happy, but this is huge. Non Tesla charging stations are universally terrible in my experience., Running a charging network is NOT easy. Just ask any Electrify America network users and they'll tell you a 50/50 chance EA's charging station doesn't work., [deleted], Somehow this was never priced in\\n\\nI feel like investors has very short memory. Guve it few more months, these same reasons will be used to pump the stock further, Tesla is a multi headed monster: auto biz, charging, energy storage, solar (not so much here), Optimus, service.\\n\\nIf the green energy revolution happens like people/governments indicate, Tesla is the all encompassing play\\u00a0, Tesla is giving away their competitive advantage. Their exclusive charging network is the only reason to choose a Tesla over one of the many other options., This was another reason I started buy Tesla a couple years ago, Ive been saying this for years, forget the Tesla cars, the real money is the charging infrastructure. Tesla is already rolling out charging stations that have local battery storage and solar panels on the charging station roofs. So Tesla can purchase power off-peak and charge their local power storage batteries and on sunny days top them up. Then sell the cheap stored off-peak power at the going rate, with solar adding to the margin., Oh boy. Reddit hates Tesla.

GM CEO Mary Barra said at the time that her company expected to save up to $400 million of a planned investment in building out EV charging stations.\\n\\nThe partnerships mark a strategy shift for Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who for years touted the exclusivity of Tesla\\u2019s charging network and his company\\u2019s ability to build reliable charging locations that would keep consumers from sitting in long lines. Becoming the charging standard has required Tesla to invest heavily in technical and business development.\\n\\nBut Tesla has plenty to gain from working with others.\\n\\nSam Fiorani, vice president for global forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions, said these efforts should eventually yield huge financial benefits for Tesla, including from environmental credits and fees for charging sessions.\\n\\nCurrently, Tesla operates about one in three charging stations in the U.S. Even if adoption of battery electric vehicles slows domestically, and the fleet of electric vehicles is smaller than what the government and many automakers planned six months ago, \\u201cTesla could still see $6 billion to $12 billion a year,\\u201d by 2030 from its expanded charging business, Fiorani said in an email.\\n\\nWhile Tesla could lose some customers to other brands by making charging easier, AutoForecast said there are other reasons car buyers flock to Tesla.\\n\\n\\u201cPeople shopping for a Tesla aren\\u2019t typically cross-shopping at Kia, Ford, or Mercedes-Benz dealers because they simply want a Tesla,\\u201d Fiorani wrote. \\u201cCompetition will continue to heat up and Tesla will inevitably lose some sales to rivals, but loyalty to the brand means the vast majority of owners will return to Tesla with little or no comparison shopping.\\u201d\\n\\nAllowing other automakers to tap its charging network also opens up some federal money for Tesla under President Biden\\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act.\\n\\n\\u201cTesla is not afraid to use government regulations for income and has been working all possible revenue streams for much of its existence,\\u201d Fiorani wrote.\\n\\nTesla didn\\u2019t respond to a request for further information.\\n\\nTesla reports charging revenue with its \\u201cTotal automotive & services and other segment revenue.\\u201d The company hasn\\u2019t said whether it may break out revenue from non-Tesla vehicle use of its charging network.\\n\\nWilliam Navarro Jameson, Tesla\\u2019s Strategic Charging Programs lead, wrote in a post on LinkedIn on Thursday that getting to this point with Ford has required a lot of \\u201cinteroperability testing\\u201d along with creating all the necessary hardware and software integrations and working through legal issues.\\n\\n\\u201cThere have been so many pieces to this puzzle that have been put in place over the past 18 months,\\u201d he wrote.\\n\\nOn social media, Tesla touted the opening up of its charging network in North America and circulated a link to entice more retailers to host Superchargers at their facilities.\\n\\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/29/tesla-to-earn-billions-from-charging-partnerships-with-ford-others.html\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 323,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2024-02-06\",\n          \"2023-08-07\",\n          \"2020-11-30\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 4071,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 41626,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 300,\n        \"samples\": [\n          6629,\n          1145,\n          3774\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"num_comments\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 488,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 3862,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 268,\n        \"samples\": [\n          732,\n          65,\n          16\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"comments\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 369,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \">In the middle, the secondary OLED screen, which also floats, has been moved higher, enlarged, and switched to a landscape layout that makes it more compatible with media and phone-mirroring apps like Apple CarPlay. **It's metallic lower edge still contains physical buttons for HVAC adjustments and the Air's center-mounted volume roller.** Below that is a huge configurable center console. Its rear half is covered by an armrest that's rear-hinged for full access, while the front half include a sliding drawer that can but pushed forward under the center screen.\\n\\nYay!\\n\\nIf they can make it compelling at 80k vs a EV Macan, this is going to be amazing.\\n\\nAlso glad it\\u2019ll have CarPlay unlike Rivian and Tesla., How does one define a minivan? Sliding doors? Because otherwise this is a minivan.\\n\\nA luxury minivan with a 0-60 at 3.5 seconds, over 400 miles of range and under $80k sounds awesome to me if those numbers all end up holding true., Not a huge pure EV fan but Lucid vehicles always catch my eye. There\\u2019s only a few cruising around where I live which may be why, but I\\u2019m happy the brand is able to continue expanding into new models., I had a spin in the Air recently, and if the SUV drives anything as well as the normal car does... Because it's by far the best driving EV out there. The electric steering is almost as good as Porsche. The chassis balance is amazing and it's ability to blend stability with comfort is great. And it's built properly and smartly. It felt good to be hustled, and even though the throttle was a bit too sharp, it drove unbelievably well for what it was (enormous 8 billion pound luxury sedan).\\n\\nAnd I think they didn't butcher the styling for the SUV conversion either. There's still a lot of \\\"form follows function\\\", but, it's not too bad. I get the impression that they're producing an \\\"engineering first\\\" product like Mercedes in the 80's did, and Toyota in the 90's did. I hope that's enough for them to survive. It worked for those companies because they're still riding on those coat-tails today.\\n\\nThis being said... it's still an ultra-luxury product. Prices really aren't below $100k so it's unobtanium for the vast majority of people. They have the SUV, and they probably have a few people in the \\\"model 3\\\" affordable car research phase at the moment which is what will allow them to actually survive as a company.\\n\\nAnd final thought - I don't like the new wheel\\\\dash layout. I disagree with TH that the old screen was obscured. The screen was intentionally blank in those areas which were cutoff. I never found myself looking to try and find info. It wasn't broken. And now they've got the squircle, which I'm not a huge fan of.\\n\\n______________\\n\\nxpost from the other thread since this thread looks like it will be \\\"the one\\\", It's giving futuristic minivan, Really well-specced and reasonably attractive family hauler. Will be interesting to see how it prices out vs. the iX, model X and so on once it\\u2019s actually released and we can see real prices and configurations. But seems like it could be a pretty compelling option., I think it looks great, much better than the Air. I think the design language works a lot better, particularly in the rear 3/4 section which I always found awkward on the Air (felt a bit bulbous sort of like OG Panamera almost), Yay another 100k 0-60 in less than 4 seconds 5000lb+ suv. Just what we need!, [deleted], plant soft doll command racial tan society somber dolls crown\\n\\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*\",\n          \"Honestly with all these big manufacturers catching up i have a hard time justifying xpev, nio and Tesla. Because in 5 years when most consumers might be looking to afford a new EV they won't buy a Chinese vehicle when there is a Volkswagen for about the same price, >Toyota plans to be the first company to sell an electric vehicle equipped with a solid-state battery in the early 2020s.\\n\\nThey gonna license this tech? Because it sounds like they're going to have an awesome battery and nothing to put it in for a few years.\\n\\nThat being said Tesla desperately needs the competition so I hope it works out., A prototype next year? I'll believe it when I see it. Scalability and affordability will be important things to look out for., Toyota sound like at best they'll have this to the market by mid-2020 based on these articles.\\n\\nAlso keep in mind, what works great in a lab environment doesn't necessarily work well in the real world. Nissan's first generation Leaf suffered from nearly 40% battery degradation in a single year in real world conditions because of this issue. And Toyota has yet to bring a single battery electric vehicle to market, the best they've done is a Plug-in hybrid with a 39 mile range battery., From an investors stand point, I think all these big manufacturers should spinoff their EVs into new companies. It will help with them with getting more investors imo., Stop using game changer if you want people to take you seriously. You sound like YouTube scam  ads., I like Toyota but I wouldn\\u2019t own their stock, This is definitely going to have huge impact on Toyota and Tesla stocks both! Get a detailed analysis on both of them here: [https://zyne.com/stock/TM](https://zyne.com/stock/TM) & [https://zyne.com/stock/TSLA](https://zyne.com/stock/TSLA)., [removed], This is good for Tesla.\",\n          \"So Tsla is going to be the Shell and Chevron EV Charge station for America?, Tesla owners won\\u2019t be happy, but this is huge. Non Tesla charging stations are universally terrible in my experience., Running a charging network is NOT easy. Just ask any Electrify America network users and they'll tell you a 50/50 chance EA's charging station doesn't work., [deleted], Somehow this was never priced in\\n\\nI feel like investors has very short memory. Guve it few more months, these same reasons will be used to pump the stock further, Tesla is a multi headed monster: auto biz, charging, energy storage, solar (not so much here), Optimus, service.\\n\\nIf the green energy revolution happens like people/governments indicate, Tesla is the all encompassing play\\u00a0, Tesla is giving away their competitive advantage. Their exclusive charging network is the only reason to choose a Tesla over one of the many other options., This was another reason I started buy Tesla a couple years ago, Ive been saying this for years, forget the Tesla cars, the real money is the charging infrastructure. Tesla is already rolling out charging stations that have local battery storage and solar panels on the charging station roofs. So Tesla can purchase power off-peak and charge their local power storage batteries and on sunny days top them up. Then sell the cheap stored off-peak power at the going rate, with solar adding to the margin., Oh boy. Reddit hates Tesla.

GM CEO Mary Barra said at the time that her company expected to save up to $400 million of a planned investment in building out EV charging stations.\\n\\nThe partnerships mark a strategy shift for Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who for years touted the exclusivity of Tesla\\u2019s charging network and his company\\u2019s ability to build reliable charging locations that would keep consumers from sitting in long lines. Becoming the charging standard has required Tesla to invest heavily in technical and business development.\\n\\nBut Tesla has plenty to gain from working with others.\\n\\nSam Fiorani, vice president for global forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions, said these efforts should eventually yield huge financial benefits for Tesla, including from environmental credits and fees for charging sessions.\\n\\nCurrently, Tesla operates about one in three charging stations in the U.S. Even if adoption of battery electric vehicles slows domestically, and the fleet of electric vehicles is smaller than what the government and many automakers planned six months ago, \\u201cTesla could still see $6 billion to $12 billion a year,\\u201d by 2030 from its expanded charging business, Fiorani said in an email.\\n\\nWhile Tesla could lose some customers to other brands by making charging easier, AutoForecast said there are other reasons car buyers flock to Tesla.\\n\\n\\u201cPeople shopping for a Tesla aren\\u2019t typically cross-shopping at Kia, Ford, or Mercedes-Benz dealers because they simply want a Tesla,\\u201d Fiorani wrote. \\u201cCompetition will continue to heat up and Tesla will inevitably lose some sales to rivals, but loyalty to the brand means the vast majority of owners will return to Tesla with little or no comparison shopping.\\u201d\\n\\nAllowing other automakers to tap its charging network also opens up some federal money for Tesla under President Biden\\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act.\\n\\n\\u201cTesla is not afraid to use government regulations for income and has been working all possible revenue streams for much of its existence,\\u201d Fiorani wrote.\\n\\nTesla didn\\u2019t respond to a request for further information.\\n\\nTesla reports charging revenue with its \\u201cTotal automotive & services and other segment revenue.\\u201d The company hasn\\u2019t said whether it may break out revenue from non-Tesla vehicle use of its charging network.\\n\\nWilliam Navarro Jameson, Tesla\\u2019s Strategic Charging Programs lead, wrote in a post on LinkedIn on Thursday that getting to this point with Ford has required a lot of \\u201cinteroperability testing\\u201d along with creating all the necessary hardware and software integrations and working through legal issues.\\n\\n\\u201cThere have been so many pieces to this puzzle that have been put in place over the past 18 months,\\u201d he wrote.\\n\\nOn social media, Tesla touted the opening up of its charging network in North America and circulated a link to entice more retailers to host Superchargers at their facilities.\\n\\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/29/tesla-to-earn-billions-from-charging-partnerships-with-ford-others.html\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 323,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2024-02-06\",\n          \"2023-08-07\",\n          \"2020-11-30\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 4071,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 41626,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 300,\n        \"samples\": [\n          6629,\n          1145,\n          3774\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"num_comments\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 488,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 3862,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 268,\n        \"samples\": [\n          732,\n          65,\n          16\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"comments\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 369,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \">In the middle, the secondary OLED screen, which also floats, has been moved higher, enlarged, and switched to a landscape layout that makes it more compatible with media and phone-mirroring apps like Apple CarPlay. **It's metallic lower edge still contains physical buttons for HVAC adjustments and the Air's center-mounted volume roller.** Below that is a huge configurable center console. Its rear half is covered by an armrest that's rear-hinged for full access, while the front half include a sliding drawer that can but pushed forward under the center screen.\\n\\nYay!\\n\\nIf they can make it compelling at 80k vs a EV Macan, this is going to be amazing.\\n\\nAlso glad it\\u2019ll have CarPlay unlike Rivian and Tesla., How does one define a minivan? Sliding doors? Because otherwise this is a minivan.\\n\\nA luxury minivan with a 0-60 at 3.5 seconds, over 400 miles of range and under $80k sounds awesome to me if those numbers all end up holding true., Not a huge pure EV fan but Lucid vehicles always catch my eye. There\\u2019s only a few cruising around where I live which may be why, but I\\u2019m happy the brand is able to continue expanding into new models., I had a spin in the Air recently, and if the SUV drives anything as well as the normal car does... Because it's by far the best driving EV out there. The electric steering is almost as good as Porsche. The chassis balance is amazing and it's ability to blend stability with comfort is great. And it's built properly and smartly. It felt good to be hustled, and even though the throttle was a bit too sharp, it drove unbelievably well for what it was (enormous 8 billion pound luxury sedan).\\n\\nAnd I think they didn't butcher the styling for the SUV conversion either. There's still a lot of \\\"form follows function\\\", but, it's not too bad. I get the impression that they're producing an \\\"engineering first\\\" product like Mercedes in the 80's did, and Toyota in the 90's did. I hope that's enough for them to survive. It worked for those companies because they're still riding on those coat-tails today.\\n\\nThis being said... it's still an ultra-luxury product. Prices really aren't below $100k so it's unobtanium for the vast majority of people. They have the SUV, and they probably have a few people in the \\\"model 3\\\" affordable car research phase at the moment which is what will allow them to actually survive as a company.\\n\\nAnd final thought - I don't like the new wheel\\\\dash layout. I disagree with TH that the old screen was obscured. The screen was intentionally blank in those areas which were cutoff. I never found myself looking to try and find info. It wasn't broken. And now they've got the squircle, which I'm not a huge fan of.\\n\\n______________\\n\\nxpost from the other thread since this thread looks like it will be \\\"the one\\\", It's giving futuristic minivan, Really well-specced and reasonably attractive family hauler. Will be interesting to see how it prices out vs. the iX, model X and so on once it\\u2019s actually released and we can see real prices and configurations. But seems like it could be a pretty compelling option., I think it looks great, much better than the Air. I think the design language works a lot better, particularly in the rear 3/4 section which I always found awkward on the Air (felt a bit bulbous sort of like OG Panamera almost), Yay another 100k 0-60 in less than 4 seconds 5000lb+ suv.

Because in 5 years when most consumers might be looking to afford a new EV they won't buy a Chinese vehicle when there is a Volkswagen for about the same price, >Toyota plans to be the first company to sell an electric vehicle equipped with a solid-state battery in the early 2020s.\\n\\nThey gonna license this tech? Because it sounds like they're going to have an awesome battery and nothing to put it in for a few years.\\n\\nThat being said Tesla desperately needs the competition so I hope it works out., A prototype next year? I'll believe it when I see it. Scalability and affordability will be important things to look out for., Toyota sound like at best they'll have this to the market by mid-2020 based on these articles.\\n\\nAlso keep in mind, what works great in a lab environment doesn't necessarily work well in the real world. Nissan's first generation Leaf suffered from nearly 40% battery degradation in a single year in real world conditions because of this issue. And Toyota has yet to bring a single battery electric vehicle to market, the best they've done is a Plug-in hybrid with a 39 mile range battery., From an investors stand point, I think all these big manufacturers should spinoff their EVs into new companies. It will help with them with getting more investors imo., Stop using game changer if you want people to take you seriously. You sound like YouTube scam  ads., I like Toyota but I wouldn\\u2019t own their stock, This is definitely going to have huge impact on Toyota and Tesla stocks both!

Non Tesla charging stations are universally terrible in my experience., Running a charging network is NOT easy. Just ask any Electrify America network users and they'll tell you a 50/50 chance EA's charging station doesn't work., [deleted], Somehow this was never priced in\\n\\nI feel like investors has very short memory. Guve it few more months, these same reasons will be used to pump the stock further, Tesla is a multi headed monster: auto biz, charging, energy storage, solar (not so much here), Optimus, service.\\n\\nIf the green energy revolution happens like people/governments indicate, Tesla is the all encompassing play\\u00a0, Tesla is giving away their competitive advantage. Their exclusive charging network is the only reason to choose a Tesla over one of the many other options., This was another reason I started buy Tesla a couple years ago, Ive been saying this for years, forget the Tesla cars, the real money is the charging infrastructure. Tesla is already rolling out charging stations that have local battery storage and solar panels on the charging station roofs. So Tesla can purchase power off-peak and charge their local power storage batteries and on sunny days top them up. Then sell the cheap stored off-peak power at the going rate, with solar adding to the margin., Oh boy. Reddit hates Tesla.

Rawlinson made those comments at FII 5, an event held in Riyadh by a Saudi Arabian sustainability nonprofit, a YouTube video shows. He also presented a slide showing that Lucid EVs are the top six longest-range, EPA-rated electric vehicles in the U.S. \\\"Lucid holds the crown for range,\\\" he said.\\n\\nA day earlier, Lucid Motors (LCID) announced the first deliveries to customers of the Dream launch edition of its Air electric sedan will begin Oct. 30.

I can't make any sense of it., It competes with the G wagon without the cult classic heritage and the aesthetics of an overweight buffalo \\n\\nIts not the fastest, it\\u2019s not the most comfortable, it\\u2019s not the best looking, it doesn\\u2019t have amazing handling, it\\u2019s somewhat competent at everything yet not great at anything, It's very expensive and arguably not even the best BMW SUV., I\\u2019m so glad BMW are being stung for creating this absolute abomination, it\\u2019s truly heinous and I hope they change their strategy.\\n\\nThe products they\\u2019ve created in the last 4-5 years have been so distant from the BMW we know. As embodied in the XM, the brand has such a confused image at the moment. This car doesn\\u2019t know what it wants to be aside from expensive\\u2026, They marketed it towards influencers and people on the edge of fashion and design. \\n\\nProblem is that those people don\\u2019t necessarily have the funds to buy a car this expensive., good, These car companies are really out of control. Just fucking look at the thing., XM probably not exactly the best name given there is Sirius XM\\u00a0, Like seriously 2020s is one of the worst era for cars. They exagerated with SUVs and expensive cars. I think thats not a EVs problem anymore. Nobody is making regular cars anymore and companies are trying to sell SUVs but there are too many of them. Thats like to eat only a cheesake everyday. First two days it's very good but if you eat only that, it becomes disgusting. We are tired of this shitty expensive trucks.\",\n          \"**Hi, welcome to /r/investing.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/investing) if you have any questions or concerns.*, Ironically it is the opposite. Jack Ma is one of the few influential and rich Chinese who are willing to publicly say something critical about the central government of China. NIO, while being a great company with a lot of growth potential, lives on government subsidy and tax allowance.\\n\\nConsequently, Baba and Ant are regulated and punished by the CCP and therefore their value is lowered due to the risk. NIO is growing well because their development is aligned well with the vision of the Chinese government.\\n\\nWestern media may be mostly critical of the Chinese government but the hedge funds are very honest with their money., I have been seeing lots of speculative news articles by writers who cannot even make the effort to do some basic research on this matter.  Personal ideologies aside, China bad or china good is linear thinking that doesn't help anyone. Both of these companies are expected to show significant growth in the future but NIO's relatively smaller size and less controversial business model makes it more attractive to some investors. BABA isn't dependent on Ant's personal finance business and anti monopoly probes in china historically result in small fines, which makes BABA in trouble argument a very weak one.\\n\\nThere are legit reasons to regulate personal finance, which is a rather different matter. Otherwise we end up in predatory financing environment where even a furniture store actively pushes people, who cannot afford their rent, to buy overpriced mattresses and not make any payments for several years.  \\n\\nBABA will ultimately recover when the dust settles . There is a reason why hedge funds are buying more rather than offloading BABA., All you need to know is that NIO trades on hype. People will pump it till the EV mania dies down., You're not missing anything. Both companies have the same risk. BABA is being scrutinized and all but both stocks represent holding companies in the Cayman Islands that are entitled to profits of original businesses in China., People aren't actually rational., BABA to the moon. Institutional buyers are loading up instead of selling off. Biden gonna mend relations with China too and put an end to frivolous anti-China executive orders., Jack Ma of BABA messed around with Beijing by openly criticizing national regulators which led to Xi-driven countermeasures.\\n\\nNio is a market participant among dozens and less likely to attract additional scrutiny. Also, Nio operates in a market where private competition is actively encouraged by the central gov't., This is an investment forum. People going \\\"China bad\\\" are really in the wrong channel. People are here to talk about ROI.\\n\\nThat being said, this is a really bad week to start going on the whole \\\"China bad\\\" thing., Here is why I wont invest in BABA and will invest into NIO.\\n\\n\\nJack Ma, even though not being the CEO anymore, has beef with the government and the government is king. If you piss the CCP off, you are out.\\n\\n\\nNIO is CCP's baby, they want this thing to happen and will invest into the company and make it grow.\\n\\n\\nAt the end of the day China can't really be trusted anyways, but id rather invest in a company that is loved by their dictator regime, than disliked\",\n          \"I almost exited my call options yesterday but thought I'll wait & see what comes out of the social-spending package..and boy, I'm glad I held on, They haven\\u2019t sold a single car and have a market cap over $60B. Insane., My bag holding is finally paying off. Hope this trend continues., Glad I doubled down on my positions (regular stocks) and didn't sell. Biggest rise day in my investing history. Have high hopes for Lucid and their share price. Even a fraction of what Tesla has become and I'd be a very happy and financially well young man.\\n\\nWishing well., I don\\u2019t see how they will sell much at a starting price point of $80k. I\\u2019m in the market for my first EV and I want a Tesla as they have great technology but their quality is ok. Big manufactures may not have the technology but will have better quality cars. \\n\\nLucid I can\\u2019t imagine will have either. They will face the same struggles Tesla did in the early stages with manufacturing and I doubt they will have superior tech to Tesla. So you can pick your preference and buy a better car either way for much less. By the time they get going the market will already have a ton of different models., made 23k profit this morning, exited, i wonder when was the moment in time this stuff stopped surprising me, Tesla nearly went bankrupt twice trying to ramp up production of the Model S/3. I can't see this working out well for them considering a tighter labor market, increased CapEx expenses and far more established EV competition.\\n\\nIt doesn't even really make sense to short Lucid right now since they are mostly a pile of cash with very few liabilities., Producing very low volume (500 or so cars in this batch) $160K cars is alot different than mass producing their cheapest $77K car....Tesla had been producing cars for years and just released their model 3 before they reached this valuation......and they were much further down the road in manufacturing and battery production optimization.....also Tesla had the extra valuation of FSD and the energy business.  Without plans produce their own batteries Lucid will have to charge alot more for thier cars and have a difficult time increasing volume, thus the \\\"luxury\\\" focus....not sure they'll beat BMW/Mercedes at luxury.  But will give them credit for tech if their energy/mile/kwh battery claims are true...we need someone to push Tesla to improve in this area as no one is even close to Tesla and for that i'll ignore the insane valuation for now., What do you guys think about buying right now? I wanted to wait until cars actually hit the street and reviews actually came out to see if there was any major flaws with production before buying. Should I just buy now or hold off a bit longer and wait for a dip?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
